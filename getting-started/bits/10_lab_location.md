On the [Student Service Center](https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-department&dept=CPSC), you can find the time, building, and room number of your lab.

Once you know the building and room number, you can use the [UBC online interactive maps](https://maps.ubc.ca) to find the building.
It'll be worth it for you to spend some time figuring out where you need to be so you're not stressed out - labs will begin in Week 2!
