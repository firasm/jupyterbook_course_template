    :class-container: sd-shadow-lg
    :color: primary
    :open:

On the left sidebar in Canvas, click on Gradescope.
You should then be guided through a series of steps to create an account on **gradescope.ca**, set a password, and link it to our course.
Note that at UBC, we use gradescope**.CA** not gradescope*.com*.

This is **very** important for you to do as it'll be our primary mechanism for submitting your work, and us delivering you feedback in this course.
