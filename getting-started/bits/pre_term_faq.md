    :open:

```{tip}
In my opinion (and there are other opinions!) the short answer is: always use `Dr.` + `<last name>` or `Professor` + `<last name>`.
So you would call me `Dr. Moosvi` in emails and in-person.
```

The long answer is a bit of a rant, so bear with me here!

There is somewhat of a tension in the Ivory Tower as it has long been accepted and assumed that students at university are considered adults and thus, should be on a first-name basis with their professors.
After all, if we want students to be comfortable in their environment, and in the name of community-building then students should drop the formalities of titles and just refer to their professors using just their first name.
Well, it's a bit more complicated than that.
It turns out that in our society, job titles have a lot of meaning and authority - particularly for minoritized individuals such as women and people of colour, who are already less likely to be perceived as experts (see [this article](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210216-why-do-professional-titles-actually-matter) for more about this).
Of course it is very uncomfortable and socially inappropriate to "correct" people about your title, it seems like "bragging" or, being "uptight" and "hierarchical", as well as a host of other adjectives I'd rather not point out.
On the other hand, we also know that students come from a variety of different cultures and backgrounds and it may be completely inappropriate and foreign for them to refer to individuals of authority by their first names.
For these students, it can result in crippling anxiety and fear to refer to their instructors by their first names when they insist, so rather than deal with the turmoil of these interactions, they choose to not to interact with their instructors at all.
This is very unfortunate, and a reminder to us all that there are always consequences to our decisions and we need to think through our established conventions through the lens of "who is this harming?".

Finally, I recognize that a lot of this may be "[hidden curriculum](https://www.edglossary.org/hidden-curriculum/)" and students may not be aware of these conventions.
I do not believe that students are intentionally referring to their instructors using incorrect honorifics (Mr., Ms., and the worst: Miss or Mrs).
However, it is an unfortunate and dark part of our society that it tends to happen way more to my female colleagues.
Practically speaking, in almost all cases^, and instructors here need a PhD to teach, so even if unintentional or accidental, you are devaluing their accomplishments and titles by referring to them as anything other than `Dr.` or `Professor`.
These titles that have been incredibly hard-earned (PhDs tend to have 5-7 years of additional education and training after a bachelor's degree), often in extremely traumatic circumstances (particularly for minoritized folks). 
In general, I encourage you all to look within yourself and fight against your inner biases when it comes to equity and inclusion.
Specifically in this case, I suggest you **always** refer to your instructors at UBC with `Dr.` + `<last name>` or `Professor` + `<last name>`.

^ *Note: In some cases, there may be exceptional senior grad students or exceptional teachers with Masters degrees, or substantial industrial experience teaching your courses. 
Even in those cases - unless they tell you otherwise - it's usually wise (and polite) to refer to them as `Dr.` or `Professor` as well.*

No, you do not need to purchase anything for this course.

It would be helpful if you had access to a computing device as we'll be conducting all of our homework, classwork, and labs digitally. If this is going to be a problem, please contact me through a private message on {{ FORUM_LINK }} and we can work out an accommodation.

```{dropdown} Will lectures be recorded so I can re-watch them to study?
    :class-container: sd-shadow-lg
    :color: primary
    :name: recorded-lectures

Lectures may be recorded and will be posted on Canvas if they are - mostly for students that miss the class and want to catch up on missed announcements.

In general, I do not think re-watching lectures is a good way to study (even at 1.5x speed).
It will be far more beneficial for you to try doing more problems and come to student hours or get extra help on the forum!

````{dropdown} What should I do if the course is full and I'm on the waitlist for the class?
    :class-container: sd-shadow-lg
    :color: primary
    :name: waitlist

If the course is full, please see [this link here](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/undergrad/courses/waitlists) for guidance and frequently asked questions.

If you are set on joining the class, I suggest attending class physically in-person for as long as possible so you are not behind if/when you do get into the course.
Note that attending classes will not increase or improve your chances to get admitted into the course.
Luckily, most of the content we use in this course is open source so you can {{ '[access the course website]({link})'.format(link=COURSE_LINK)}}.

```{tip}
Unfortunately the **course instructor has no control over student registration** and you will not be able to join the Canvas course until you are officially registered in the class.
If you have specific questions, I suggest contacting an advisor.

    :name: hard-course

We have done our best to setup this course so that if you are willing (and able) to put the work in, you will leave this course with a good grades!
I can pretty much guarantee that - there are lots of opportunities for you to work collaboratively with your peers during the lectures and on homework assignments.
There will be frequent tests (roughly every two weeks) in this course and you will always have an opportunity to redo your test for a higher grade.

If you come in with good work ethic, the right attitude, and sufficient motivation, you will do really well - I promise!
```

```{dropdown} Is attendance mandatory in lectures?
    :class-container: sd-shadow-lg
    :color: primary
    :name: attendance

- Attendance is **highly recommended** in lectures, but not required.
- Lectures may be recorded and if they are, will be made available via Canvas.
- Note that there are several passing requirements in this course - it's highly unlikely you'll be able to pass the course if you skip the lectures!
