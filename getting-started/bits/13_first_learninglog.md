Once you're done everything else in the week and **after the last class of the week**, you should have access to the first Learning Log.
This assignment will help you get familiar with answering "Learning Log" questions and tasks on the PrairieLearn platform.
I will respond to your learning logs over the weekend, and next week, show you how to access your feedback.
