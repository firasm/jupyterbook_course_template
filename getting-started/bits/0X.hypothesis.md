There's a really awesome tool called [hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is) - when enabled, it allows anyone to highlight and comment on any website.
I have turned this feature on for our unsyllabus because I want to know what you think of the unsyllabus in our course!
Yes, it's *our* course, we're in this together and there are some opportunities for you to determine how we do things in this course.
I want your thoughts, feedback, and opinions on how you want the course to go this term.
Similarly, if you have any questions about any part of the unsyllabus, the best place to ask it is right in the document itself.
If you have a good idea for a change to the unsyllabus - I'd love to hear them, and even adopt them if they fit within the goals of the course.
I strongly believe that you are now in charge of your own education, and I am just a guide to help point you in the right direction!

Here's an animated gif of how to annotate (you'll need to sign up for a free account):

This is an experiment, and I encourage you to make comments and highlights on our unsyllabus.
Let's see how it goes!
Remember that your classmates will be able to see your comments too, so feel free to interact with them on here as well - we're in this together.
Don't be shy, but please also be respectful and courteous.
