Canvas is the go-to platform at UBC.
You can access it by going to: https://canvas.ubc.ca and logging in with your CWL.
I expect you'll find most of your courses to be using the Canvas platform.
All the information and content for this course will be posted on Canvas.

In my course, the left sidebar is where you will find most things.
It's fairly intuitive, but the Centre for Teaching, Learning, and Technology has created a [Canvas Student Guide](https://lthub.ubc.ca/guides/canvas-student-guide/).
