Week 9 Summary
=======================

## List of things to do this week

Below is a list of things you need to do this week, links to where you can do them, as well as roughly the order you should do it.
Note that these are just SUGGESTIONS and you are by no means required to them this way. 
I have put the labs at the end, but if your lab section is earlier in the week, you may want to shift things around to accommodate that.
