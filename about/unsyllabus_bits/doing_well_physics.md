### ... but I've never been good at physics or math!

That's okay! 
You're still more than welcome in this course.
I will do everything I can (within reason) to still make the course accessible to you.
This course is designed with your success in mind.
There are multiple opportunities for you to learn from your mistakes and improve your grades in nearly every aspect of the course.
In my opinion, the best learning happens when folks are given the opportunity to make mistakes so they get over their fear of trying something!
At the beginning of the term, we will all do a Math Diagnostic (not for marks) to check if you have the required math background for this course. 
If you do not, I have some supplemental material for you to catch up.
My expectation is that you'll complete the exercises and review the supplemental material in the first couple of weeks.

To summarize, if you've never been "good" at physics or math, come into the course with a healthy attitude, a desire to work for your success, and I have no doubt you will be successful in this course. 
If you ever want to talk about the course, or have any feedback you want to give me, do not hesitate to reach out to me!

### ... but I don't even like physics or math!

Believe it or not, I have no expectation that every student that takes my course will have an undying passion for the subject.
Some of you may be forced to take this course by your programs, faculties, career interests, etc...
Sometimes we all have to take courses that we think we don't like, or enjoy. 
That's fine!
No judgement from me, you are more than welcome in this course.
I just ask that you not make any snap judgements about the class, the material, the instructor (me), or the teaching team.
Whatever your motivations are for taking this course, give us a chance, maybe you don't HAVE TO be miserable taking this course!
You might even enjoy the feeling of community and camaraderie that develops over the course of the semester :-). 

I hope you're not miserable, if you do feel miserable, come talk to me - maybe I can help you see the light at the end of tunnel?
