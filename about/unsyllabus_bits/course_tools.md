```{warning}
I will be the first to acknowledge that my courses are usually heavily reliant on learning technologies.
I strongly believe that learning technologies are essential (for me) to give you my students a good experience in the course.
Many times during the course you may be frustrated why we need to use so many different tools, and why there isn't one tool that does everything.
Believe me, this frustrates me too (particularly because each of your instructors will be using different tools depending on their needs), and is something that I'm working on improving.
At the moment, the reality is that many learning technologies often only do *one thing* very well.
This of course means that other functionalities take a back-seat and exist merely to check a box on their marketing website (just to say they have the feature).

**In all of my courses, before selecting a learning technology, I do a very careful scan of the landscape, weigh the pros and cons, consider the privacy implications, the convenience aspects, and then select the ones that I believe will best support my teaching goals at minimal inconvenience to students. In general, I also use tools that are fun to use!**

I hope you will be patient with all the tools used in this course, I hope I can demonstrate value to you by using them in our course.
If you have any feedback about my usage of the tools, I'd be happy to [get your (anonymous) feedback](page_feedback) and though it may not always be possible to make changes mid-semester, I will certainly keep your feedback in mind as I plan the next iteration of this course.
```

All tools used in the course will be used in a [FIPPA-compliant](https://universitycounsel.ubc.ca/subject-areas/access-and-privacy-general/access-to-information/about-fippa/) manner, with your privacy top of mind. 
New tools may be added to the course as the need arises, and I will update this section with the appropriate information and make an announcement if a new tool is added midway through a course.

There is no cost to the student for any of the tools used in this course.

```{tip}
Even though the tools above are required for this course, if you have a moral or legal objection to my use of these tools, please do reach out to me and we can likely find an acceptable accommodation.
