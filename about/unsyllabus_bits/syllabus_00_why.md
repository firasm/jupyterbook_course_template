**Why is there a Syllabus and an Unsyllabus for this course?**

Traditionally, there has been a culture at most higher education institutions for every course to have a document that sets expectation for how the course will be conducted, what students will be expected to do, and what they will learn in the course.
The purpose of that document was for the instructor to communicate "what the course will be about" to students so they know what they're getting themselves into.
This document is typically called a "Syllabus" or a "Course Outline".
Over the years however, this document has morphed into something like a contract - a "terms of service" that students implicitly agree to by registering for the class.

This makes me somewhat uncomfortable as an educator - I don't want to legislate how you learn and what you need to do to learn.
I also don't want there to be an unchangeable legal document governing the interactions between an instructor and a student.
What I do want is to give you suggestions and guidelines supported by my personal experience as well as the latest literature on teaching and learning.

That being said, perhaps there are some advantages to having some elements of a course codified in a "legal document" - the "Syllabus".
For instance, the instructor for the course, the calendar course entry, the term dates, the final exam period, the passing criteria, how to file a grievance or complaint, and your responsibilities to uphold UBC Okanagan's commitment to equity, diversity, and inclusion.
The items above are indeed permanent and unchanging, and deserve to be in the syllabus. 

Other things, such as what you will learn, how and when you will do it are more flexible and fluid.
For that, we have this unsyllabus.

### What is the Unsyllabus? 

In contrast to the syllabus, the unsyllabus is not a legal document. Instead, it is a *living document* that serves students and adjusts to their needs and feedback.
Dr. John Warmer describes this best [in his article, "A syllabus is not a contract"](https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/just-visiting/syllabus-not-contract):

> ... this [un]syllabus is not a contract, it is a living document which reflects the experiences, emotions, philosophies, and goals I bring to a particular course.

and also: 

> An [un]syllabus as a plan is a lot like an itinerary before a trip. 
> Thereâ€™s some definite highlights we need to hit, but if something that seems cool and worth doing crops up unexpectedly, we need to seize that opportunity in the moment. 
> If something really bad happens (the equivalent of a norovirus breakout on a cruise ship) we may need to abandon something previously scheduled entirely.

### Summary

Having an adaptive syllabus is important to me as it allows me to be responsive to your feedback in a meaningful way.
I invite you to be co-contributors to this unsyllabus, and use the tools provided to add your own annotations, questions, and suggestions on making this syllabus work for you.
At various points in the term, I will invite you to provide feedback on how things are going in the class.
You may use those opportunities (or any other using the anonymous {{ ANON_FEEDBACK }} or {{ FORUM_LINK }}) to propose adjustments to how the class is running for consideration.

|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Syllabus   | University-mandated, like a legal contract and contains university rules about conduct and behaviour;  elements will not change.                         |
| Unsyllabus | Living document, responsive to student feedback and adaptable to circumstances; elements may change, usually to the benefit of students and of learning. |
