For a detailed description of my teaching philosophy and values (including a list of references and citations), you can [read it here](https://firas.moosvi.com/cv/teaching-philosophy/).
Here are the key principles I intend to apply in this class:

1. Student learning is vastly improved through active learning
1. Learning technologies must be leveraged to scale instructor effort across multiple classes.
1. Inter-disciplinarity is the future of education.
1. Effective teaching is inclusive teaching.
