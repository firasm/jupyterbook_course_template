For a detailed description of my teaching philosophy and values (including a list of references and citations), you can [read it here](https://firas.moosvi.com/cv/teaching-philosophy/).
Here are the key principles I intend to apply in this class:

1. Student learning is vastly improved through active learning
1. Learning technologies must be leveraged to scale instructor effort across multiple classes.
1. Inter-disciplinarity is the future of education.
1. Effective teaching is inclusive teaching.

### How will this course be taught ?

This course will be taught as a [Blended Learning classroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blended_learning) where some elements of a [flipped classroom](https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BCIxikOq73Q) will be mixed with a more traditional coding classroom with live demos, clicker questions, and worksheets.
Briefly, this requires students to watch videos and engage with the assigned reading prior to the classroom meeting (knowledge transfer).
During the class meeting, the instructor guides students through clicker questions, worksheet problems, and other activities to help the students make sense of the material (sense-making).
See {numref}`masterymodel1` for a mental model of how learning works {cite}`Ambrose2010`.

To develop mastery in a concept, students must first acquire the necessary skills, then practice integrating them, and finally know when to apply what they have learned. This figure was adapted from Figure 4.1 of the book "How Learning Works".
The terms "knowledge transfer" and "sense-making" applied in this context is generally attributed to [Dr. Eric Mazur](https://mazur.harvard.edu/files/mazur/files/flip_your_course_online_07.pdf).

### What does this mean in practical terms? 

{numref}`masterymodel2` shows a handy table to help guide you and organize your learning in this course:

This table describes how I think each course activity should be classified between knowledge transfer and sense-making.
