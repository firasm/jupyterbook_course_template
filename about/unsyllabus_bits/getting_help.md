The best way to get personalized help in this course is to attend the "Student Hours" we have scheduled for this course.
They are all done on Zoom and this is time that the instructor and TAs have set aside to help YOU personally, 1 on 1!
I understand it might feel intimidating to come to Student Hours, but we don't bite!
We would love to hear about you, what your interests are, and if you have any career advice. 
If nobody comes to the Student Hours, we end up sitting in a Zoom room all by ourselves, all alone, and sad.

A few other notes:

- We will be using {{ FORUM_LINK }} for Announcements in this course.
- For **all** course-related questions you can reach out to the teaching team including instructors and TAs via {{ FORUM_LINK }}.
- You are encouraged to post questions publicly whenever possible so others can benefit. For private and personal issues, you can send private messages on {{ FORUM_LINK }}.
- Any student may visit the student hour for any member of the teaching team (TA or instructor)! In other words, you can go to the student hour of ANY TA, not just the one whose lab/tutorial you are registered in. 

### A message from your instructor

Will add a video message here soon.

Closer to the start of the term, I will update the video below with an actual message to the students :-).
Until then, enjoy being [Rick-Rolled](https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/rickrolling/).
