### Ed Discussion [Required]

In this course, we will be using {{ FORUM_LINK }} for class discussions.
You will need to sign up for a (free) Ed Discussion account to participate in the discussions for this course.
The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the TA, and myself.

```{tip}
In general, please do NOT email questions to the instructor and TAs unless it is a legitimate emergency (or if you cannot access Ed Discussion). If you do this accidentally, it's okay - we will send you an automated response letting you know that emails will not be answered and you should re-post your question on Ed Discussion.
