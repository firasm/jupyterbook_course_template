### GitHub [Required]

Git is a modern and open-source distributed version control system that aims to facilitate collaborative software development, data analysis, and [even writing poetry](https://writerly.dev).
We use Git because it is technically sound, very good at what it does, and is a system where many communities (perhaps uniquely!) have largely converged on a single system (with some exceptions, see below) for version control.
In the [2022 Stack Overflow Developer survey](https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/01/09/beyond-git-the-other-version-control-systems-developers-use/), 93% of respondents reported using Git as their system of choice for version control.

Git is the underlying system that facilitates distributed work on code bases, and GitHub is one cloud-based provider that hosts Git repositories, and offers useful convenience features to facilitate collaboration between multiple developers (and even single developers).
Of course, there are alternatives to GitHub for hosting Git repositories (similar to how there are various email providers that will host your email like Google, Yahoo, Proton Mail, etc...).
We chose to use GitHub.com mostly because of the existence of GitHub Classroom, which helps instructors with a lot of the logistics of repository management.

```{warning}
Data on GitHub (typically your course labs, assignments, and projects) is stored on servers outside Canada. When you access this site by clicking on the link through Canvas, you are being transferred to these servers. GitHub does require you to create an account on their servers. **There is no requirement from this course for you to share any personal information on GitHub servers.** UBC cannot guarantee security of your private details on servers outside of Canada. Please exercise caution whenever using your personal information online. You may wish to use a pseudonym account to protect your privacy if you have concerns about this.

Here is a quick video to show you how to create a GitHub account:
