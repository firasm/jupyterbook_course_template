### Link your Canvas account to Gradescope

On the left sidebar in Canvas, click on Gradescope.
<img src="../images/GradescopeAccount.gif" width = 100%>

You should then be guided through a series of steps to create an account, set a password, and link it to our course.

This is **very** important for you to do as it'll be our primary mechanism for delivering you feedback in this course.

```{warning}
Please verify that you do not have duplicate Gradescope accounts, this is more likely to happen when you have used Gradescope in the past with a different emails, though it has been known to happen to students who accidentally created two accounts on initial signup.

If the email associated with Gradescope is correct, things should be all good.
If not, then you may need to merge multiple accounts together, [see details on how to do that here](https://help.gradescope.com/article/ipjyg27lg5-student-merge-accounts).
