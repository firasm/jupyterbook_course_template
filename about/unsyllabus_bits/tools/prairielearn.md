### PrairieLearn

PrairieLearn is an open source, extensible online assessment platform built on modern web technologies and is available to students at no cost.
This system replaces commerical textbook publisher platforms for homework assignments such as MasteringPhysics, WileyPlus etc.
In the past, instructors were forced to use these expensive options and pass these costs on to the students, to the tune of $60/student per course with just a temporary "subscription" to a textbook.
Today, thanks to the emergence of high-quality open-education resources (OERs), student advocacy (see the [UBC Senate policy](https://vancouver.calendar.ubc.ca/campus-wide-policies-and-regulations/academic-assessment/fee-based-digital-learning-tools-used-assessment)) and institutional support (the [TLEF](https://tlef.ubc.ca/funded-proposals/?filter_43=&filter_42=&filter_15=&filter_34=&gv_search=PrairieLearn&mode=all) and the [ALT-2040](https://alt-2040.ok.ubc.ca/funded-projects/) projects), and free and open source software (FOSS) we have alternatives.

In the first week of class, we will do a demo of the PrairieLearn platform together, but if you'd like to get started, you can [join the course and do the first assignment by clicking here](https://ca.prairielearn.com/pl/course_instance/2439/assessment/18407).
