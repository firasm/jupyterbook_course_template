First of all, I'm sorry you're having trouble and are considering withdrawing from the course!
This is no problem, and I will not be personally offended or upset you need to do this, I encourage you to do what you feel is right for you and your situation. 
Below is some information that might be helpful for you in making the decision.

```{warning} Please note that it is the student's responsibility to check the withdrawal dates as [listed in the UBC Calendar](https://vancouver.calendar.ubc.ca/dates-and-due dates).
```

^ Note: Withdrawal after this date cannot happen without additional approvals, see [here](https://vancouver.calendar.ubc.ca/campus-wide-policies-and-regulations/withdrawal/introduction).

There are factors other than money and your transcript to consider as well, including your mental health, graduation requirements/timelines, [course load requirements](https://students.ubc.ca/enrolment/courses/course-load-guide), eligibility for student loans, bursaries, scholarships etc. 
I advise you to [read a list of some considerations](https://science.ubc.ca/students/blog/impact-of-a-w) here and consult with an advisor if you have additional questions.

```{warning}
International students have additional factors to consider when withdrawing - you are urged to follow-up with an advisor and see the [frequently asked questions here](https://students.ubc.ca/international-student-guide/immigration/taking-time-away-school-international).
