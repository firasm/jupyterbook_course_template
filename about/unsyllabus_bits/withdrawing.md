First of all, I'm sorry you're having trouble and are considering withdrawing from the course!
This is no problem, and I will not be personally offended or upset you need to do this, I encourage you to do what you feel is right for you and your situation. 
Below is some information that might be helpful for you in making the decision.

```{warning} Please note that it is the student's responsibility to check the withdrawal dates as [listed in the UBC Calendar](http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/okanagan/index.cfm?go=deadlines).
```

| After {{ W_DATE_3 }} ^ | W on transcript      | [See policy details](https://students.ok.ubc.ca/courses-money-enrolment/finances/tuition-and-fees/) |

^ Note: Withdrawal after this date cannot happen without approval from the Faculty (Email: fos.students.ubco@ubc.ca).

There are factors other than money and your transcript to consider as well, including your mental health, graduation requirements/timelines, [course load requirements](https://students.ok.ubc.ca/courses-money-enrolment/finances/student-loans-and-grants/course-load-requirements/), eligibility for student loans, bursaries, scholarships etc. 
I advise you to [read a list of some considerations](https://students.ok.ubc.ca/courses-money-enrolment/registration/late-course-changes/) here and consult with an Academic Advisor or your Program Advisor if you have additional questions.

```{warning}
International students have additional factors to consider when withdrawing - you are urged to follow-up with a GEO advisor (geo.ubco@ubc.ca) and see the [frequently asked questions here](https://students.ok.ubc.ca/new-to-ubc/immigration-documentation/immigration-impacts-of-withdrawing/).
