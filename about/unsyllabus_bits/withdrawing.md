First of all, I'm sorry you're having trouble and are considering withdrawing from the course!
This is no problem, and I will not be personally offended or upset you need to do this, I encourage you to do what you feel is right for you and your situation. 
Below is some information that might be helpful for you in making the decision.

```{warning} Please note that it is the student's responsibility to check the withdrawal dates as [listed in the UBC Calendar](http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/okanagan/index.cfm?go=deadlines).

There are factors other than money and your transcript to consider as well, including your mental health, graduation requirements/timelines, eligibility for student loans, bursaries, scholarships etc.
I advise you to [read the full list of considerations](https://students.ok.ubc.ca/courses-money-enrolment/registration/late-course-changes/) here and consult with an Academic Advisor or your Program Advisor if you have additional questions.
