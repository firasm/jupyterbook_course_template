## Course Tools

### Required Tools

In this course, we will be using the following required learning technologies (privacy policies linked): 

- [Canvas](https://faculty.canvas.ubc.ca/canvas-privacy/)
- [Ed Discussion](https://edstem.org/privacy)
- [Sli.do](https://www.sli.do/terms#privacy-policy)
- [Mastering Physics](https://www.pearson.com/en-us/legal-information/privacy-policy.html)

All tools used in the course will be used in a [FIPPA-compliant](https://universitycounsel.ubc.ca/subject-areas/access-and-privacy-general/access-to-information/about-fippa/) manner, with your privacy top of mind. 
New tools may be added to the course as the need arises, and I will update this section with the appropriate information and make an announcement if a new tool is added midway through a course.

```{warning}
Even though the tools above are required for this course, if you have a moral or legal objection to my use of these tools, please do reach out to me and we can likely find an acceptable accommodation.
```

### Sign up for a (free) Ed Discussion account [Required]

This term we will be using {{ FORUM_LINK.replace('JOIN_LINK', ED_ID) }} for class discussion.
The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the TA, and myself.
Please do NOT email questions to the instructor and TAs unless it is a legitimate emergency (or if you cannot access Ed Discussion).

```{warning}
The Ed Discussion tool is stored on servers outside Canada. When you access this site by clicking on the link through Canvas, you are being transferred to these servers. In order to protect your identity, UBC obfuscates your user ID before it is sent to the site. However, Ed Discussion does require you to create an account on their servers. While Ed Discussion adheres to strict U.S. privacy regulations (FERPA), UBC cannot guarantee security of your private details on servers outside of Canada. Please exercise caution whenever using personal information. You may wish to use a pseudonym to protect your privacy if you have concerns.
```

### What type of information will I collect about you in this course?

Having taught [DSCI 541: Privacy, Ethics, and Security](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI_541_priv-eth-sec) in the UBC Master of Data Science in the past, I am very aware of the surveillance culture that has permeated our society and heralded the [End of Privacy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NesTWiKfpD0) as we know it.
That being said, as an instructor, I care tremendously about your learning and the course-related data that is collected about you is extremely valuable. 
Broadly speaking, this relatively new field is called **Learning Analytics**.
[Learning Analytics](https://www.solaresearch.org/about/what-is-learning-analytics/) involves the collection and analysis of data about learners for the [express purpose](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/the-express-purpose-of) of improving their learning by optimizing teaching and learning practices.

All of the tools above log data about your activity that can be used to improve the quality of teaching and learning.
In this course, I intend to use this information to:

- view overall class progress (in aggregate),
- track your personal progress in order to provide you with personalized feedback,
- track participation in discussion forums
- improve the course and your learning, 
- explore students actions in the course, 
- provide you feedback on your progress.

Unfortunately, at the moment it is not possible to opt-out of the data collection process, but if you like, you may opt-out of the process where *I use the data to give you personalized feedback*. 
To opt-out, please {{ ANALYTICS_OPTOUT }} at any point in the course. 
You may opt-out with my full support, I respect your decision and applaud you for your netizenship!
