The grading scheme for this course is here:

| Item                  | Weight          | Due date(s) |
|-----------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Homework Assignments  | 25% (10 x 2.5%) | TBD         |
| Labs                  | 25% (10 x 2.5%) | TBD         |
| Tests (& Bonus Tests) | 25% (5 x 5%)    | TBD         |
| Learning Logs         | 5% (10 x 0.5%)  | TBD         |
| Final Exam            | 20%             | TBD         |

There will be 5 tests in this course in an (approximately) bi-weekly schedule.
For each of the tests, there will be a bonus test exactly one week later and the better score of the Test-Bonus Test pair will be taken.

```{attention} 
All deadlines in this course have an automatic 48 hour grace period after the due dates listed above.
Any submissions submitted past the grace period will not be graded (with some exceptions).
```

### What are the passing requirements for this course?

- All students must satisfy ALL conditions to pass the course:
    1. Pass the Lab component with a grade of at least 50%,
    1. Pass the Test and Exam components (together) with a grade of at least 50%,
    1. Pass the Final Exam with a grade of at least 40%.

If students do not satisfy the appropriate requirements, the student will be assigned the **lower** of their earned course grade or, a maximum overall grade of 45 in the course.

### What do I need to purchase for this course?

The following are required items for this course, and their costs (in $CAD) are:

- Textbook ($XX)
- Access to online homework system ($XX)
- Lab Manual ($0)

Being very conscious of the high tuition and technology costs, I have made efforts to minimize the additional cost of taking this course.
Below is a justification of each required item and why I think you need it to succeed in this course.

```{warning}
Do not procrastinate buying access to the online homework system! You will need it right away.
```

#### Textbook

```{tip}
The required **textbook** for this course is: [Physics for Scientists and Engineers, 4e by Randall D. Knight](https://www.campusebookstore.com/integration/AccessCodes/default.aspx?bookseller_id=240&Course=PHYS+111.001&frame=YES&t=permalink).
```

It is required because you need a reference text for this course, as well as practice problems, and a homework system.
The Mastering Physics homework system comes bundled with this textbook.

```{attention}
tl;dr version: Purchase the eText + Mastering Physics access code for $115.50 + tax. This is all you will need.
```

The cost for a new e-Text (with MasteringPhysics code) is listed above.
With the e-Text, there is no option to purchase separate volumes and you will get access to the full textbook.
If you choose to purchase a physical copy from the UBCO Bookstore, there is also no choice - you will need to purchase both volumes ($150 + tax).
Volume 1 contains all of the material required for PHYS 111 and will be lighter and more portable. 
If you purchase the full physical textbook, it will include Volume 2 which will (tentatively) be used in the second part of Introductory Physics for the Physical Sciences (PHYS 121) in term 2.

Either an e-Text or a physical textbook will work as long as you have the Mastering Physics access code to get access to the homework system.
New textbooks from the UBCO bookstore have it included.
If you purchase your textbook from elsewhere, or have a used textbook you’ll need to purchase it separately. 
**Update**: there is now option to purchase just the Mastering Physics access for \$50.50 from the link above. 
To be clear, the UBCO Bookstore has three options: 1) eText with Mastering Physics access code (\$115.50 + tax), 2) Physical textbook with Mastering Physics access code (\$150 + tax), 3) Mastering Physics access code only (\$50.50 + tax). Most students will choose choose Option 1.

```{warning}
The UBCO bookstore has warned me there may be shipping delays due to COVID-19 if you choose to get a physical textbook. If you’re ordering it online or through the bookstore, I encourage you to call or email to confirm there is stock, and that the shipping times (if applicable) are reasonable before placing the order.
```
#### Online homework system

```{tip}
The required online homework system for this course is: **Mastering Physics**
```

It is required and is a companion product to our textbook.
There is considerable research ([here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1949-8594.1995.tb15736.x) and [here](https://www.learningscientists.org/learning-scientists-podcast/2017/10/4/episode-4-spaced-practice)) that suggests distributed practice is more helpful for long term retention and overall learning.
Furthermore with online Mastering Physics interface, your textbook, homework assignments, and tests are all on Mastering Physics.
Mastering Physics also has some integrated study modules that can help you test yourself and take more effective notes.

#### Lab Manual

```{tip}
The required lab manual for this course is: Available on Canvas, free of charge.
```

In the past, this lab manual had to be purchased from the UBC Bookstore.
This year, because the labs are all online, a digital version of the lab manual is available to you on Canvas free of charge.
