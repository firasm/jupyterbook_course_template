Unforeseen events include (but may not be limited to) the following: ill health or other personal challenges that arise during a term and changes in the requirements of an ongoing job.

## Grievances and Complaints Procedures

A student who has a complaint related to this course should follow the procedures summarized below:

- The student should attempt to resolve the matter with the instructor first. Students may talk first to someone other than the instructor if they do not feel, for whatever reason, that they can directly approach the instructor. 
- If the complaint is not resolved to the student's satisfaction, the student should e-mail the Associate Head, {{ ASSOCIATE_HEAD }} or the Department Head, Dr. John Braun at [john.braun@ubc.ca](mailto:john.braun@ubc.ca).

## Academic Integrity

The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity.
As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity.
At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required.
This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work.
Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed.
For example, incidences of plagiarism or cheating may result in a mark of zero on the assignment or exam and more serious consequences may apply if the matter is referred to the President’s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline.
Careful records are kept in order to monitor and prevent recurrences.

A more detailed description of academic integrity, including the University’s policies and procedures, may be found in the [Academic Calendar](http://okanagan.students.ubc.ca/calendar/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,0.)

If you have any questions about how academic integrity applies to this course, please consult with your professor.

## Grading Practices

Faculties, departments, and schools reserve the right to scale grades in order to maintain equity among sections and conformity to University, faculty, department, or school norms. 
Students should therefore note that an unofficial grade given by an instructor might be changed by the faculty, department, or school.
[Grades](http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/okanagan/index.cfm?tree=3,41,90,1014) are not official until they appear on a student's academic record.
If you have any questions about how academic integrity applies to this course, please consult with your professor.

## Disability Assistance

The Disability Resource Centre ensures educational equity for students with disabilities, injuries or illness.
If you are disabled, have an injury or illness and require academic accommodations to meet the course objectives, [visit our website](https://students.ok.ubc.ca/drc/welcome.html) for more information or contact the DRC at: [drc.questions@ubc.ca](mailto:drc.questions@ubc.ca).

## Equity, Human Rights, Discrimination and Harassment

### Online learning for international students

During this pandemic, the shift to online learning has greatly altered teaching and studying at UBC, including changes to health and safety considerations.
Keep in mind that some UBC courses might cover topics that are censored or considered illegal by non-Canadian governments.
This may include, but is not limited to, human rights, representative government, defamation, obscenity, gender or sexuality, and historical or current geopolitical controversies.
If you are a student living abroad, you will be subject to the laws of your local jurisdiction, and your local authorities might limit your access to course material or take punitive action against you. UBC is strongly committed to academic freedom, but has no control over foreign authorities (please visit [this calendar page](http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/okanagan/index.cfm?tree=3,293,866,0) for an articulation of the values of the University conveyed in the Senate Statement on Academic Freedom).
Thus, we recognize that students will have legitimate reason to exercise caution in studying certain subjects.
If you have concerns regarding your personal situation, consider postponing taking a course with manifest risks, until you are back on campus or reach out to your academic advisor to find substitute courses.
